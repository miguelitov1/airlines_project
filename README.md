Attached are the export of the MySQL database, the backend in Node.js with Express, the frontend in Angular 12+, and the entries in Postman.

In the backend's .env file, complete "DATABASE_PASSWORD" with the database password.

Once the backend and frontend are started, login with the default user in Postman and copy the accessToken. Paste it in the frontend's "airline-backend.service.ts" file (.\src\app\airline-backend.service.ts), in the "private token" variable. Alternatively, you can create a new user and use that instead.
